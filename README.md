# daily-maths
Daily dose of simple maths. Stay sharp.

# Installation
Just build it with 
```bash
go build
```

# How to use it?
I'm not sure as well. For now there are 3 difficulty levels (Easy, Medium & Hard) which should be set in the config file.
Everything currently is for `+` (plus) operation and the difference between difficulty levels is in the rage of numbers. 

# Is this finished?
Hahaha... no.
